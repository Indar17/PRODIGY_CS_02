This is my fourth task given to me as a cyber-security intern at Prodigy InfoTech.
This Python software offers the ability to use pixel manipulation techniques 
for both encryption and decryption of images. It processes images and 
manipulates arrays using NumPy and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). 
Make sure you have the following in order to run this code: Python Imaging 
Library, or PIL: Use pip to install the PIL library: "pip install pillow"
1. To begin the encryption or decryption process, enter the path to the 
image file.
2. A random key will be generated by the script and used for encryption.
3. The encrypted and decrypted pictures will be stored in the 
encrypted_image.png and decrypted_image.png directories, correspondingly.
